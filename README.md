# CRUD-express
This project is a simple CRUD application built with Express.js and MongoDB.

## Dependencies

- Node.js: An open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- MongoDB: A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

## Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the server with `npm start`.

## Using Postman

Postman is a popular API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. You can download it [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database developed by the same people that build MongoDB. Here is a [guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) on how to set it up.

## Running the project

After setting up the environment and the database, you can start the server with `npm start` and make requests to it using Postman.
