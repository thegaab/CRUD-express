# CRUD-express
This project is a simple CRUD application built with Express.js and MongoDB. It uses Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, to manage relationships between data, provide schema validation, and translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

## Dependencies
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/): An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): An open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

## Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Start the server with `npm start`.

## Using Postman

Postman is a popular API client that makes it easy for developers to create, share, test and document APIs. You can download it [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

## MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas is a fully-managed cloud database developed by the same people that build MongoDB. Here is a [guide](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) on how to set it up.

## Running the project

After setting up the environment and the database, you can start the server with `npm start` and make requests to it using Postman.
